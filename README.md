## Installation

First, clone this project to your computer. In Visual Studio Code, you can clone the project from https://github.com/mortonne/datascipsych-project.git using the `Git: Clone` command.

If you have previously cloned the project, make sure you have the latest version of the code. In Visual Studio Code, pull the latest changes by running the `Git: Pull` command or clicking the sync icon in the lower left.

This should install Python, create a virtual environment, and install a number of Python packages. Finally, open the Command Palette, run `Python: Select Interpreter`, and choose the new virtual environment, which should be named `Python 3.13.6 (datascipsych)` or `datascipsych (3.13.6)`.
